Project Notes
-------------
Once you have received batch load reports from OCLC, you can take the information in
them and update your bib records with correct OCLC numbers. The OCLC numbers are stored
in the .035. field of a bib record. This script relies on the fact that at EPL we match
our records in OCLC with the Title Control Number (TCN, or flex key) on our system. All 
of our bib records contain at least 2 .035. fields; the TCN which is the same as the
record's Sirsi number, and an OCLC number. When this script is run it reads all the reports
in the working directory (specified with $OCLC_DIR variable below), parses the reports
looks up the TCN listed in the report, extracts all the .035. records for each TCN, REPLACES or adds
any (Sirsi) <number> found with the record's accession number (.1003.), removes all (OCoLC) <number>
entries and replaces with the OCLC number listed in the report, then replaces any other 
.035. records it found for the record unmolested. If -U is used the changes are committed
to the ILS.
